        <h5>Bargain Beef Wellington $30.00</h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Tender, mouthwatering beef tenderloin, encased in a rich mushroom duxelles and prosciutto, 
            then enveloped in golden, flaky puff pastry. Baked to perfection, this classic masterpiece is served with a 
            velvety red wine reduction and a side of seasonal vegetables. A luxurious, indulgent experience that's sure to 
            delight your taste buds. <br><br> Although Henry Clay was the speaker of the house, he was 4th in the race for presidency. Using his authority, he made a bargain with John Quincy Adams to make Adams president and himself the Secretary of State. This made Andrew Jackson lose the presidency that he was previously winning.</p> <img src="BeefWell.jpg" style="width:50%;max-width:1000px;margin-top:32px;"> <br>
            <h5>Rachel Red Snapper $26.00</h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">This fish has various spices and inclusions that give each bite a new burst of flavor. This fish is cooked to perfection with a crunchy bottom yet soft, melting top. With a small side of vegetables, this dish is an alternative dish to people who do not eat meat. 
          <br><br>When Rachel Donelson married Andrew Jackson she was revealed to still have been married to Lewis Robards. This was due to her Lawyer not securing her divorce properly which caused a scandal. Rachel died of an illness but Andrew Jackson blamed her death on the other women demeaning her because of her scandal. He believed that their mean comments and remarks heightened her sickness, causing her illness to progress.

    <div id="Beverage" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card">
      <h5>Silver Bullet Cocktail $15.00</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This cocktail has a refreshing, bitter taste with a hint of orange. This drink will keep you refreshed and give you a mouthwatering experience. With the inclusion of silver specs from the bullet in Jackson’s chest, a touch from the past is now with you forever.  
        <br><br>Dickinson and Jackson were involved in a duel where Dickinson shot Jackson right near his heart. This shot broke Jackson’s ribs and severed into his chest just 2 inches away from his heart. Jackson survived the bullet and lived with this bullet in his chest for the rest of his life. 
        
        </p><img src="SilverBull.jpg" style="width:50%;max-width:1000px;margin-top:32px;"> <br>
      <h5>Teary Martini $12.00</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This martini has an inviting look with a heavenly taste that will encapture all of your senses. It has a kick of olives that balances out all of the rich flavors. This martini is not one to miss and will make your experience at Homemade old Hickories one to remember.
        <br><br>Andrew Jackson forced Native Americans to walk 60 miles from the Smokey Mountains to Oklahoma causing many to die from the cold weather and hunger. He did this relocation to open up land to new settlers. This was one of Andrew Jackson’s most controversial orders that still has an impact today.

      <div id="Appetizer" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card">
        <h5>1400lb Cheese with Crackers $14.00</h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">The 1400lb Parmesan cheese has been aged for 2 years. Letting it age gives cheese a harder and firmer texture allowing for a sharper taste. This cheese is amazingly paired with homemade crackers. This appetizer is a light snack that pairs well with the teary martini and brioche BUS crab melts. 
          <br><br>In 1835 Andrew Jackson left a 1400lb block of cheese in the center of the Entrance Hall and let it age for 2 years. In 1837, Jackson invited people to come and eat it. The cheese was nearly four feet in diameter, two feet thick, but the guests ate all of it in minimal time. This block of cheese left a stain on the carpet in the Entrance Hall for many years.

        <h5>Brioche Bus Melts $12.00</h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">This savory, miniature sandwich that includes light and airy crab is a delightful choice. This appetizer can serve as a light starter to one of our main courses, but can also serve alone as a dish because of the quantity on the plate. With 4 delicate sandwiches in each serving, this dish is one of our best sellers. 
          <br><br>He opposed the BUS because he believed Congress did not have the Constitutional authority to create it. Jackson believed the BUS gave wealth to few and decided to shut down the BUS and install State Banks. He claimed that the President had the right to interpret the Consitution.

      <div id="Sides" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card">
        <h5>Calhoun Clam Chowder $18.00</h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">This sweet and savory soup dish contains clams, diced potatoes, and various forms of onions. This soup has various flavors that combine into one delectable dish. Although this soup is involved with clam, there is not a significant fishy taste which makes it stand apart from other clam chowders. 
          <br><br>Although John C. Calhoun and Andrew Jackson disagreed over various policies, Andrew Jackson admitted Calhoun as his vice president. Calhoun supported state rights and nullification while Jackson supported state rights but not at the expense of the United states as a whole. Jackson saw Calhoun as untrustworthy, selfish, and as a rival. Due to all of these differences, Jackson’s presidency with Calhoun was a battle. 
          </p><img src="ClamChowder.webp" style="width:50%;max-width:1000px;margin-top:32px;"> <br>
        <h5>Homemade Old Hickory Salad $16.00</h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">This original, homemade salad is a staple at Homemade Old Hickories. There is chicken, fresh lettuce, pepper, and a lemon glaze. This salad can be served with any dish on the menu and compliments any dish due to its refreshing flavor. 
          <br><br>Andrew Jackson’s nickname “Old Hickory" was placed upon him due to his strict military presence and his toughness in dangerous situations. He was seen as determined and selfless, often standing and suffering alongside his men in very dangerous situations. He was as tough as an old hickory and was seen as a man anyone could lean on.

    <div id="Desserts" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card">
      <h5>Inaugural Party Purfait $13.00</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The Inaugural Party Parfait is more than a dessert; it's a symbol of a new beginning. Perfectly suited for significant events such as presidential inaugurations, gala parties, or milestone celebrations, this exquisite creation is a fusion of flavors and textures designed to delight the senses and mark a momentous occasion in style.
        <br><br>Andrew Jackson was the 7th President of the United States, and his presidential inauguration in 1829 was known for being a particularly festive and widely attended occasion.

      </p><img src="PartyParf.webp" style="width:50%;max-width:1000px;margin-top:32px;"> <br>
      <h5>Texas Treschleches $17.00</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The Texas Treschleches is a dessert that brings the vibrant flavors of Texas to the iconic Tres Leches cake. A slice of this indulgent treat is a journey through a symphony of tastes and textures, starting with the delicate sponge cake that melts in your mouth.
        <br><br>In 1836, President Andrew Jackson acknowledged Texas' desire to become a state. However, he stated that this would require care and diplomatic negotiations. Jackson recognized the benefits of adding Texas to the U.S., such as expanding the nation's territory and its agriculture
